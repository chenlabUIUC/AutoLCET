# Getting started
1. Download "contrast_correction_UNet.ipynb".  
2. Download the training and testing datasets at: xxxx. Copy them to the same folder as where "3D_UNet.ipynb" locates.  
3. Optionally download our trained model at: xxxx. Copy it to the same folder as where "3D_UNet.ipynb" locates.  
4. Run "contrast_correction_UNet.ipynb" either locally with Jupyter Notebook or on cloud with Colab. Skip the model training process to directly predict the testing data if you want to use our trained model.
